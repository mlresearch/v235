title: Harnessing the Power of Neural Operators with Automatically Encoded Conservation
  Laws
openreview: ToHkAg936Y
abstract: Neural operators (NOs) have emerged as effective tools for modeling complex
  physical systems in scientific machine learning. In NOs, a central characteristic
  is to learn the governing physical laws directly from data. In contrast to other
  machine learning applications, partial knowledge is often known a priori about the
  physical system at hand whereby quantities such as mass, energy and momentum are
  exactly conserved. Currently, NOs have to learn these conservation laws from data
  and can only approximately satisfy them due to finite training data and random noise.
  In this work, we introduce conservation law-encoded neural operators (clawNOs),
  a suite of NOs that endow inference with automatic satisfaction of such conservation
  laws. ClawNOs are built with a divergence-free prediction of the solution field,
  with which the continuity equation is automatically guaranteed. As a consequence,
  clawNOs are compliant with the most fundamental and ubiquitous conservation laws
  essential for correct physical consistency. As demonstrations, we consider a wide
  variety of scientific applications ranging from constitutive modeling of material
  deformation, incompressible fluid dynamics, to atmospheric simulation. ClawNOs significantly
  outperform the state-of-the-art NOs in learning efficacy, especially in small-data
  regimes.
