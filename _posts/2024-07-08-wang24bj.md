title: How to Trace Latent Generative Model Generated Images without Artificial Watermark?
openreview: TwZ2sY6eJj
abstract: 'Latent generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) have become more and
  more popular, but concerns have arisen regarding potential misuse related to images
  generated by these models. It is, therefore, necessary to analyze the origin of
  images by inferring if a particular image was generated by a specific latent generative
  model. Most existing methods (e.g., image watermark and model fingerprinting) require
  extra steps during training or generation. These requirements restrict their usage
  on the generated images without such extra operations, and the extra required operations
  might compromise the quality of the generated images. In this work, we ask whether
  it is possible to effectively and efficiently trace the images generated by a specific
  latent generative model without the aforementioned requirements. To study this problem,
  we design a latent inversion based method called LatentTracer to trace the generated
  images of the inspected model by checking if the examined images can be well-reconstructed
  with an inverted latent input. We leverage gradient based latent inversion and identify
  a encoder-based initialization critical to the success of our approach. Our experiments
  on the state-of-the-art latent generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, show
  that our method can distinguish the images generated by the inspected model and
  other images with a high accuracy and efficiency. Our findings suggest the intriguing
  possibility that today’s latent generative generated images are naturally watermarked
  by the decoder used in the source models. Code: https://github.com/ZhentingWang/LatentTracer.'
