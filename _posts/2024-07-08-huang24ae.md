title: An Embodied Generalist Agent in 3D World
openreview: V4qV08Vk6S
abstract: 'Leveraging massive knowledge from large language models (LLMs), recent
  machine learning models show notable successes in general-purpose task solving in
  diverse domains such as computer vision and robotics. However, several significant
  challenges remain: (i) most of these models rely on 2D images yet exhibit a limited
  capacity for 3D input; (ii) these models rarely explore the tasks inherently defined
  in 3D world, e.g., 3D grounding, embodied reasoning and acting. We argue these limitations
  significantly hinder current models from performing real-world tasks and approaching
  general intelligence. To this end, we introduce LEO, an embodied multi-modal generalist
  agent that excels in perceiving, grounding, reasoning, planning, and acting in the
  3D world. LEO is trained with a unified task interface, model architecture, and
  objective in two stages: (i) 3D vision-language (VL) alignment and (ii) 3D vision-language-action
  (VLA) instruction tuning. We collect large-scale datasets comprising diverse object-level
  and scene-level tasks, which require considerable understanding of and interaction
  with the 3D world. Moreover, we meticulously design an LLM-assisted pipeline to
  produce high-quality 3D VL data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate LEO’s
  remarkable proficiency across a wide spectrum of tasks, including 3D captioning,
  question answering, embodied reasoning, navigation and manipulation. Our ablative
  studies and scaling analyses further provide valuable insights for developing future
  embodied generalist agents. Code and data are available on project page.'
