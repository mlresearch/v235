title: 'MAGDi: Structured Distillation of Multi-Agent Interaction Graphs Improves
  Reasoning in Smaller Language Models'
openreview: ffLblkoCw8
abstract: 'Multi-agent interactions between Large Language Model (LLM) agents have
  shown major improvements on diverse reasoning tasks. However, these involve long
  generations from multiple models across several rounds, making them expensive. Moreover,
  these multi-agent approaches fail to provide a final, single model for efficient
  inference. To address this, we introduce MAGDi, a new method for structured distillation
  of the reasoning interactions between multiple LLMs into smaller LMs. MAGDi teaches
  smaller models by representing multi-agent interactions as graphs, augmenting a
  base student model with a graph encoder, and distilling knowledge using three objective
  functions: next-token prediction, a contrastive loss between correct and incorrect
  reasoning, and a graph-based objective to model the interaction structure. Experiments
  on seven widely used commonsense and math reasoning benchmarks show that MAGDi improves
  the reasoning capabilities of smaller models, outperforming several methods that
  distill from a single teacher and multiple teachers. Moreover, MAGDi also demonstrates
  an order of magnitude higher efficiency over its teachers. We conduct extensive
  analyses to show that MAGDi (1) enhances the generalizability to out-of-domain tasks,
  (2) scales positively with the size and strength of the base student model, and
  (3) obtains larger improvements (via our multi-teacher training) when applying self-consistency
  – an inference technique that relies on model diversity.'
