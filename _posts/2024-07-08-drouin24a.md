title: 'WorkArena: How Capable are Web Agents at Solving Common Knowledge Work Tasks?'
openreview: BRfqYrikdo
abstract: We study the use of large language model-based agents for interacting with
  software via web browsers. Unlike prior work, we focus on measuring the agents’
  ability to perform tasks that span the typical daily work of knowledge workers utilizing
  enterprise software systems. To this end, we propose WorkArena, a remote-hosted
  benchmark of 33 tasks based on the widely-used ServiceNow platform. We also introduce
  BrowserGym, an environment for the design and evaluation of such agents, offering
  a rich set of actions as well as multimodal observations. Our empirical evaluation
  reveals that while current agents show promise on WorkArena, there remains a considerable
  gap towards achieving full task automation. Notably, our analysis uncovers a significant
  performance disparity between open and closed-source LLMs, highlighting a critical
  area for future exploration and development in the field.
